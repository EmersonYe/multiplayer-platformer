This is a project inspired by [Ultimate Chicken Horse](https://www.cleverendeavourgames.com/ultimate-chicken-horse), a party platformer game where you build the level as you play, placing traps and hazards to screw your friends over, but trying not to screw yourself.

I also drew inspiration from [Victor Zhou's example-.io-game](https://github.com/vzhou842/example-.io-game).

# Development
1. Clone this repository and cd into it:
```
git clone git@github.com:EmersonYe/multiplayer-platformer.git
cd multiplayer-platformer
```
2. After verifying that Node and NPM are installed, run `npm install` to install dependencies on your local machine.
3. Start the server locally in either development or production mode (development recommended).
    * To start the server in development mode, run `npm run develop`.
    * To start the server in production mode, run `npm run build`, then `npm start`.
4. Start the client by visiting `localhost:3000` in a browser.
